<p>The big idea behind One Good Tutorial is right there in the name. The OGT
philosophy says: it would be wonderful if every project could have truly great
documentation, but rarely do the stars align to make that possible. Most of us
are going to have to start with documentation that’s “good enough”. And what’s
good enough? <i><b>One good tutorial.</b></i></p>

<p>One Good Tutorial was developed specifically to support the authors of
scientific software, but we hope that it will be helpful to people who work on
all kinds of technical projects.</p>
