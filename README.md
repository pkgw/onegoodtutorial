[**One Good Tutorial**](https://onegoodtutorial.org/) is a resource for people
who are documenting scientific software. The main idea is right there in the
name: the most important thing is that your software’s documentation includes
*one good tutorial*. You need a bit more than that, but not much more: the [One
Good Tutorial software documentation checklist](https://onegoodtutorial.org/)
defines nine core elements of scientific software documentation. The resource
also includes [a playbook](https://onegoodtutorial.org/playbook/) you can follow
to prepare these nine elements with a minimum of angst and a number of
supporting [in-depth guides](https://onegoodtutorial.org/in-depth/).

Visit [onegoodtutorial.org] for all the details. The [About page][about] has
information about the One Good Tutorial project itself.
