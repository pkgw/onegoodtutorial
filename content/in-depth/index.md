In support of the [One Good Tutorial Checklist](/) and the [One Good Tutorial
Playbook](@/playbook.md), we’ve prepared a number of **in-depth guides** that go
into the details about how to prepare different standard elements of software
documentation. They cover the following topics:

- [Acknowledgment Statements](@/in-depth/acknowledgments.md)
- [Citation Instructions and Software Citation](@/in-depth/software-citation.md)
- [Contribution Statements](@/in-depth/contribution-statements.md)
- [Installation Instructions](@/in-depth/installation-instructions.md)
- [Licensing Statements and Software Copyright](@/in-depth/licensing-statements.md)
- [Writing a Project Synopsis](@/in-depth/synopsis.md)
