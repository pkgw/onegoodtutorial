The documentation of scientific software should often contain an
**acknowledgments** section that gives credit to the funders that supported
work on the software.

Many funders will require such acknowledgments and provide specific guidelines
about what form they should take. (See, e.g., [the NSF’s policies][nsf].) In
other cases, an acknowledgment may not be formally *required*, but it’s hard to
see a downside to acknowledging generously. But if a work was truly created
without any external support, you can skip the acknowledgments section.

Your acknowledgments section should also, of course, include any other
recognitions that you deem necessary and/or appropriate.

For most software, the acknowledgment statement will be short, and it needs not
live on its own page.


# Spelling

You can spell “acknowledgment” either with or without a third “e” after the “g”.
Various clickbaity sources online suggest that the version with two “e”s is
generally preferred in North America, and three “e”s elsewhere. The difference
is subtle enough that you should probably feel safe using whichever version you
prefer.


# Acknowledging One Good Tutorial

If you found this resource useful during the preparation of your software’s
documentation, you are encouraged — but not obligated — to mention it in your
acknowledgments section. See [the About
page](@/about/index.md#citing-or-acknowledging-one-good-tutorial) for a suggested
statement.
