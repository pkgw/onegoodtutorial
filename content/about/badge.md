If you’re reading this, you probably clicked on a badge that looked like this:

![One Good Tutorial docs checklist v1: adopted](../../badge/adopted-v1.svg)

And you’re probably wondering what exactly those words all mean. Good news:
that’s the point of this page!

**_This badge means that the project displaying it has used the [One Good
Tutorial software documentation checklist](@/_index.md) to guide the preparation
of its documentation._** By completing the checklist, the authors of this
project have done their best to ensure that their documentation covers all the
bases — most importantly, they’ve prepared at least **one good tutorial** to
help you learn how their software works.

We can’t promise perfection (it would be an impressive checklist that could!)
but this badge shows that someone put some care into their documentation work,
and hopefully that shines though in your experience.

To learn more, check out [the One Good Tutorial landing page](@/_index.md). The
One Good Tutorial framework is aimed at authors of open-source scientific
software, but we hope that it is useful for all kinds of technical projects.
