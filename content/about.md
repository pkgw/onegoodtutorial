[**One Good Tutorial**](https://onegoodtutorial.org/) is a resource for people
who are documenting scientific software. The main idea is right there in the
name: the most important thing is that your software’s documentation includes
*one good tutorial*. You need a bit more than that, but not much more: the [One
Good Tutorial software documentation checklist](https://onegoodtutorial.org/)
defines eight core elements of scientific software documentation. The resource
also includes [a playbook](https://onegoodtutorial.org/playbook/) you can follow
to prepare these eight elements with a minimum of angst and a number of
supporting [in-depth guides](https://onegoodtutorial.org/in-depth/).

One Good Tutorial was developed by [Peter K. G.
Williams](https://newton.cx/~peter/) with the support of a [Better Scientific
Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program).
