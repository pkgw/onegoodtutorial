    "description": "<p><b>One Good Tutorial</b> is an instructional resource for people who are documenting scientific software. It’s delivered as a static website canonically served at <a href=\"https://onegoodtutorial.org/\">https://onegoodtutorial.org</a>.</p><p>The main idea is right there in the name: the most important thing is that your software’s documentation includes <i>one good tutorial</i>. You need a bit more than that, but not much more: the <i>One Good Tutorial software documentation checklist</i> defines nine core elements of scientific software documentation. The resource also includes a <i>playbook</i> you can follow to prepare these nine elements with a minimum of angst and a number of supporting <i>in-depth guides</i>.</p><p>The materials deposited with Zenodo include the built One Good Tutorial static website and its underlying source code.</p>",
