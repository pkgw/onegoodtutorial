    description: '<p><b>One Good Tutorial</b> is a learning resource for people \
who are documenting scientific software. It’s delivered as a static website \
canonically served at \
<a href="https://onegoodtutorial.org/">https://onegoodtutorial.org</a>.</p><p>\
The main idea is right there in the \
name: the most important thing is that your software’s documentation includes \
<i>one good tutorial</i>. You need a bit more than that, but not much more: the \
<i>One Good Tutorial software documentation checklist</i> defines eight core \
elements of scientific software documentation. The resource also includes a \
<i>playbook</i> you can follow to prepare these eight elements with a minimum \
of angst and a number of supporting <i>in-depth guides</i>.</p><p>The materials \
deposited with Zenodo include the built One Good Tutorial static website and \
its underlying source code.</p>',
