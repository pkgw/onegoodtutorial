    "description": "<b>One Good Tutorial</b> is a resource for people who are documenting scientific software. The main idea is right there in the name: the most important thing is that your software’s documentation includes <i>one good tutorial</i>. You need a bit more than that, but not much more: the <i>One Good Tutorial software documentation checklist</i> defines eight core elements of scientific software documentation. The resource also includes a <i>playbook</i> you can follow to prepare these eight elements with a minimum of angst and a number of supporting <i>in-depth guides</i>. The materials deposited with Zenodo include the built One Good Tutorial static website and its underlying source code.",
